Month Class

Design a class named Month. The class should have the following private members:

name A string object that holds the name of a month, such as “January,” “February,” and so on.

monthNumber An integer variable that holds the number of the month. Forexample, January would be 1, 

February would be 2, and so on.

Valid values for this variable are 1 through 12.

In addition, provide the following member functions:

• A default constructor that sets monthNumber to 1 and name to “January.”

• A constructor that accepts the name of the month as an argument. It should set name

to the value passed as the argument and set monthNumber to the correct value.

• A constructor that accepts the number of the month as an argument. It should set

monthNumber to the value passed as the argument and set name to the correct month name.

• Appropriate set and get functions for the name and monthNumber member variables.

• Prefix and postfix overloaded ++ operator functions that increment monthNumber

and set name to the name of next month. If monthNumber is set to 12 when these

functions execute, they should set monthNumber to 1 and name to “January.”

• Prefix and postfix overloaded −− operator functions that decrement monthNumber

and set name to the name of previous month. If monthNumber is set to 1 when these

functions execute, they should set monthNumber to 12 and name to “December.”

Also, you should overload cout’s << operator and cin’s >> operator to work with the

Month class. Demonstrate the class in a program.
